# Draggy Drop
A drag-and-drop chat app -- /r/ProgrammerHumor hackathon submission for most overengineered app.

[Try it out live, here!](https://ben.world/draggy-drop/)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3

### Setup
To run the app yourself, you can run the following steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benbusby/draggy-drop.git
cd draggy-drop
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./run.sh
```

Once the app is running, navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser to start using Draggy Drop.

## Features
- Bleeding edge drag-and-drop chat interaction
  - Note: Make sure to trade off mouse arms periodically to even out all of the muscle building from dragging and dropping.
- Freedom from the confines of "keyboards", which are for luddites anyways.
- Condescending alerts for when users try to do anything that doesn't involve dragging and dropping.
- Animated background that emulates a dragging and dropping motion, in case users forget what they're supposed to be doing.
- An exhaustive JSON dictionary containing most words that the average person would ever need to say.
